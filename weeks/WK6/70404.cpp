/* Class Scores:
Write a program that calculates the total grade for N classroom exercises as a percentage.
The user should input the value for N followed by each of the N scores and totals.
Calculate the overall percentage (sum of the total points earned divided by the total points possible).
Output the result as a percentage, and be cheeky about it.
